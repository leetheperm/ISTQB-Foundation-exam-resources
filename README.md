# ISTQB-Foundation-exam-resources
What I used to prepare for the ISTQB foundation exam. All online resources are free and offline resources are not.

## Offline resources

### Software Testing: An ISTQB-BCS Certified Tester Foundation Guide (Book)

This book served as  the best oracle for knowledge that I found of the resources, as it is written and managed by the creators of the qualification. It is a bit expensive, hence why i got an older version and will list more resources. If you can get a 2018 syllabus version, your life will be a lot easier. Not only does this book go through the modules in the correct order with the correct facts, when you find conflicting information online, this is where you can assert such information.

### A guide to ISTQB Foundation certificate (Book) (Neeraj Kumar Singh)

On its own the book can be a little sparce on detail, but Neeraj also posts links to his excellent video series, which I will link to later. A combination of the book and video series will be a great resource for your preparation.

### Guru99

This site needs no introduction to software testers, and will become extra useful when preparing for your tests. it contains mock tests, detailed definitions of test principles and useful articles explaining how each process or test type relates and where it fits in to a test strategy. Not only that, but this site has excellent resources for other technical subjects and is generally well maintained and updates often.

Very similar to Guru 99, but with arguably more mock exams and a good place to get diverse sources in your preparation.

## ISTQB Official resources

On this site you can download a few mock tests and read the exam syllabus, which I recommend getting used to as it will help you with your preaparation. The only downside of this particular page is that there are only 2 mock tests and you're unlikely to get those exact questions in the exam
